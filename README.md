# Halfling

A structured wrapper for Hobbit, a minimalistic microframework built on top of [Rack](http://rack.github.io/). A nice blend of `hobbit` and `hobbit-contrib`, with automatic template discovery, controller mapping, and some assumptions about app filesystem layout.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'halfling'
# or this if you want to use hobbit master
# gem 'halfling', github: 'slact/halfling'
```

## Why even is?

For convenience. I like Hobbit, but it lacks a couple of things.
